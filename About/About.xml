I made this mostly as a companion mod to my other stuff-mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787438435]Stuff Mass Matters[/url] but when I got started I added other changeable properties as well.
You can currently modify the following properties on all stuff, vanilla and modded:

[list]
[*]Commonality
[*]Mass
[*]Market value
[*]Beauty offset
[*]Beauty multiplier
[*]Sharp damage multiplier
[*]Blunt damage multiplier
[*]Sharp armor power
[*]Blunt armor power
[*]Heat armor power
[*]Heat insulation
[*]Cold insulation
[*]Flammability
[*]Flammability multiplier
[*]Max hitpoints multiplier
[/list]

If you have suggestions of other properties that you would like to be able to change just leave a comment and I'll look into adding it.

Since modding is just a hobby for me I expect no donations to keep modding. If you still want to show your support you can gift me anything from my [url=https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/Mlie]Wishlist[/url] or buy me a cup of tea.
