# ChangeStuffProperties

I made this mostly as a companion mod to my other stuff-mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787438435]Stuff Mass Matters but when I got started I added other changeable properties as well.
You can currently modify the following properties on all stuff, vanilla and modded:



- Commonality
- Mass
- Market value
- Beauty offset
- Beauty multiplier



If you have suggestions of other properties that you would like to be able to change just leave a comment and I'll look into adding it.
If you want to change with more precision, try the https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2218078784]Better Sliders mod

Since modding is just a hobby for me I expect no donations to keep modding. If you still want to show your support you can gift me anything from my https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/Mlie]Wishlist or buy me a cup of tea.
